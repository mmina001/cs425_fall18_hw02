                <h1>Short Bio</h1>
                <p>John Doe was born in Florida and now divides his time all over of American. Having worked
                    professionally for many years in poverty-alleviation programmes around the world, he turns to
                    photography to remind himself of the beauty that exists in a world of economic, social and
                    political injustice. His photography focuses on discovering abstract expressions of this beauty in
                    the natural world: in small patches of ice, on the water surfaces, among leaves in tidal pools.
                    John's work has been exhibited in galleries across the United States and has won a number of
                    awards. His images can be found in corporate and private collections in the United States and
                    Europe.</p>
